# Medical Credentials

Veronika has a traditional European Medical Education. As such, she underwent all the training that medical doctors in North America receive and more. Her extra studies included courses in preventative medicine (e.g. hygiene), nature-based treatments (including herbology, hydrotherapy and oxygen therapy), and homeopathy. Ultimately, she would go on to earn a doctorate in clinical immunology.

After graduation from medical school, Veronika worked in the Ukraine as a family doctor and general practitioner for 10 years. In 2001 she was awarded the position of assistant professor at the Kiev Medical Academy, Department of Post Graduate Studies. Over the course of her medical career, Veronika has authored 14 scientific papers in the fields of immunology, allergology and internal medicine.

# Credentials in Homeopathy

Veronika has studied homeopathy with such masters as Dr. Tatiana Popova ([Popov School of Homeopathy, Kiev](http://www.homeopat.kiev.ua/)), George Vithoulkas ([ International Academy of Homeopathy, Greece](http://www.vithoulkas.com/)) and Andre Saine ([ Canadian Academy of Homeopathy](http://www.homeopathy.ca/)). In 2009 she became the third Canadian to earn a diploma from the Vithoulkas Classical Homeopathy program. She is also a part of Andre Saineâ€™s select research and peer review group and one of the leaders in his Materia Medica project.

# Philosophy and Teaching

Veronika, her husband, and five children immigrated to Canada in 2002. Since that time her career and studies have been predominantly focused on homeopathy. In addition to her practice, Veronika volunteers regularly as a homeopath at the Scott Mission and gives lectures and workshops throughout the province of Ontario.

To date she has taught on such topics as:

* The levels of health
* Homeopathic treatment of common colds and flues
* The physical examination: for holistic practitioners
* Propedeutics of internal diseases
* Homeopathic treatment of respiratory diseases

Veronika strongly believes that holistic treatments, such as homeopathy, are the most effective way toward the restoration of health. As a practitioner she holds fast to the [seven fundamental principles of medicine](http://homeopathica.ca/www.homeopathy.ca), adapted from the Hippocratic Corpus by Andre Saine.

# The Seven Fundamental Principles of Medicine

Adapted from the Hippocratic Corpus by naturopathic doctor, Andre Saine, of the Canadian Academy of Homeopathy

1. Sapere aude : The physician must dare to know and become a true scientist and philosopher. Constant inquiry is the way to knowledge.
2. Praeventum: Prevention is better than cure. Therefore, the highest mission of the physician is to guide people to follow a lifestyle that is conductive to good health.
3. Primum non nocere: Firstly, physician do no harm. In spite of the best prevention, people will be affected by numerous influences and will fall sick. Any diagnostic or therapeutic intervention by the physician should not further harm the patient.
4. Tolle causatum: Remove the cause. There are causes of sickness, and above all the physician will address them.
5. Vis medicatrix nature: The healing power of nature. It is neither the physician nor the treatment that heals but only the living organism. Therefore, the physician must seek to encourage this innate process by first making sure that the conditions of health are met and, if necessary, by using the help of the various outer forces and influences of nature to enhance the recovery of health.
6. Nunquam pars pro toto: Never the part but always the whole: the physician considers the patient as a unique indivisible whole and therefore takes into consideration the physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, genetic and environmental aspects of each individual.
7. Cito, lenis, jucunde ,toto, durabile, certo, simplex et tuto curare: The highest ideal of therapy is the rapid, gentle, pleasant, complete and permanent restoration of health in the surest, simplest and least harmful way.
