# Food and Dietary Advice

Always try to eat the freshest and the least processed food. It is better to use locally grown produce.

Please avoid using a microwave for cooking or even defrosting.

Food should be processed to the least degree while cooking. Baking, broiling, and steaming are excellent choices instead of frying. Oils should be added to the already cooked food.

If occasional eating fried food, it would be recommended to consume some fresh cold pressed oil within the same meal. When your body consumes the “good oil” first, the trans-fat oil will have less of a negative effect. Only cold pressed oil should be used (e.g. olive oil or flaxseed oil).

It is critical to eat some leafy vegetables daily, e.g. salads, parsley, dill, etc. Vegetable salads could be consumed in generous quantities.

Please remember that there are at least 7 different types of hot cereals (e.g. oatmeal and buckwheat), as well as different types of bran. It is very beneficial for your health to eat hot cereal daily. Hot cereals should only be cooked with water. Dried fruit, nuts, and honey, cold pressed oil should be added to you hot cereal when it is ready.

Please limit all starchy products and carbs – potatoes (except young ones), pasta, white rice, popcorn and chips.

Whole grain bread and rye bread should always be a part of your diet.

When we have a balanced diet, we don’t need to eat much animal protein. In fact our gut micro flora is capable of producing proteins. Nuts, legumes, beans, lentils and peas can compensate for animal proteins. Beef has the highest nutritional value of all animal proteins, followed by a young lamb, venison, and chicken. The best way to prepare fish is to steam or broil it in the oven at a low temperature.

You should have separate daytime periods for the consumption of carbohydrates and proteins. The carbs – potatoes, bread and cereals should be eaten in the morning and afternoon until 2 p.m., while proteins – meat, fish, eggs, milk, cottage cheese, nuts, soy beans and peas, should be eaten in the afternoon (after 2 p.m.) and evening.

Ayurvedic medicine taught us that many fruits are not compatible with each other, so it would be better to eat them separately with some time intervals.

Healthy individuals should not drink more than 1.5-2 liters per day (depending on the weather and climate conditions). For people suffering from chronic illnesses, this amount needs to be reduced.

Please avoid all processed juices, fruit drinks and pop. Healthier choices include fresh pressed juices and drinks based on (preferably) fresh and frozen berries. Sugar should be replaced with honey, agave nectar or fructose.

Black tea and coffee can be replaced with green tea or herbal infusions , but please consult with your doctor first. These infusions should be varied, each being consumed continuously for no longer than one week. Please avoid packaged tea as it contains too many chemical additives.
